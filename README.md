## About

<div align="justify">
ZenHub is a custom startpage for web browsers designed to be as simple and as straightforward as possible. ZenHub is supported on multiple web browsers such as **Google Chrome** and **Mozilla Firefox**. I made this because I'm tired of seeing my browser default startpage.
